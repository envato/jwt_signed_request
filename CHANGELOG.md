## [v2.5.3] - 2020-02-07

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the Faraday middleware empties request body in Faraday v1.0.0

## [v2.5.2] - 2020-02-06

### Changed

- Remove restriction on JWT version < 2.2

## [v2.5.1] - 2019-01-29

### Changed

- Added option `bearer_schema` to the Faraday middleware to allow the caller to specify whether to follow the [Bearer schema](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt#how-do-json-web-tokens-work-) when setting the JWT token in the Authorization request header (defaults to false)

## [v2.5.0] - 2019-01-21

### Changed

- Ensure we use the JWT Token in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. We will still support Authorization headers without the Bearer schema

### Caveats

- Requests signed using version 2.5.0 can only be successfully verified by version 2.5.0. This will be addressed in version 2.5.1. To ensure compatibility it is recommended to skip this version or update the version of your request verifying service prior to the request signing service

## [v2.4.1] - 2019-01-08

### Changed

- Add support for JWT version 2.1

## [v2.4.0] - 2018-07-24

### Changed

- Added ability to configure verification leeway via the rack middleware

## [v2.3.0] - 2018-06-15

### Changed

- Use `JWT.decode` to extract the `kid` a JWT token.

## [v2.2.0] - 2018-04-05

### Changed

## [v2.1.1] - 2017-09-14

## [v2.1.0] - 2017-08-31

### Changed

- Check `PATH_INFO` instead of `REQUEST_PATH` when performing path exclusion

## [v2.0.0] - 2017-06-21

### Changed

- Added ability to add signing and verifying keys to the `KeyStore`
